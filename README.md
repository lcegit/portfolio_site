# My portfolio site

This is my static portfolio site that I've built using the framework **Middleman** and which I've written using the templating language **HAML**. Content is looped in from yaml files using **Ruby injection methods**. For styling, I've used the front-end framework Foundation. My goal is to use **TDD** as I add improvements to the site.

**The site is deployed using Surge:**

Here's a WIP of my **[portfolio site](http://lisaeriksson.surge.sh/)** â€“ I aim to add projects to this as I progress throughout the Craft Academy course :)
