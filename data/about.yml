- name: About me
  title: Designer / Junior Developer / Project Manager
  description: Iâ€™m multidisciplinary designer with creative, strategic and technical capabilities in my spectrum. I enjoy crafting visually compelling communication and services and have experience in visual design and content creation for global brands. I'm currently working as a visual designer at F&B Factory. When I'm not working, I enjoy travelling, photography, art and design. Oh, and I live in a construction zone as my sambo is adding another storey to our house.
